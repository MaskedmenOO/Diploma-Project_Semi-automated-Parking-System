# Diploma-Project_Semi-automated-Parking-System
The following code was used for my Diploma Project. Youtube Link : https://youtu.be/1N0b3VP3fA8

The code was made by Chee Kah Wai.

The Diploma Project uses a total of 4 stepper motors. In the original plans it would have used 9 stepper motors. Due to budget issues, my supervisor was willing to compromise and letting my team just build 1 platform for each floor.

As the Arduino can only control one CNC shield which only controls 3 stepper motors that can move independently, I had to use 2 Arduinos to control 2 stepper motor each.
